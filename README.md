This is a REACT JS Website made with the help of material UI and RapidAPI.

RapidAPI helps us get all the exercises information (gifs, name, details etc.) . we also use a youtube related API from Rapid API that helps us recommend videos relating to the exercise the user is looking at.

Material UI was used to style and design this web app. things like BOX, Stack, Pagination, Typography et were commonly used.

We also used HTML, CSS and js for the deelopment and design of this web app.
